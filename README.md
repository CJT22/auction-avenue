# Auction Avenue
This is a dynamic web application we made using HTML, CSS, and PHP as a group final project requirement for the DWEB and IMAN subjects in Holy Angel University's 2nd Year, 2nd Semester Web Development course.

Auction Avenue is an interactive auction or online bidding website for highly rare items and collectibles. It aims to streamline the process of bidding through online means to reach people globally. The website features real-time bidding updates so people can check and decide promptly about the items they like. Enthusiasts from wherever in the world can participate and place their bid at the comfort of their homes using their phones, tablets, or computers; all are possible with just a tap of their finger.
